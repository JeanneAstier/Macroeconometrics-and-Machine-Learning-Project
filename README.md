Louis Blanco & Jeanne Astier

This repository contains out Macroeconometric and Machine Learning Project. The aim of the project is the replicate and extend an article. This repository contains the following resources:

- Paper to replicate -> Forecasting Inflation in a Data Rich Environment The Benefits of Machine Learning Methods.pdf
- Supplemental materials from the authors -> supplementary material.pdf
- Report summarizing our findings (delivrable for this project) -> report.pdf 
- Replication code -> replication folder
  - 4 main scripts: 01_get_fred_data.R, 02_random_walk_oos_y.R, 03_call_model.R, 04_eval_results.R to be run in that order
  - functions called by the 4 main scripts -> functions folder
  - data used -> data folder
  - forecasts built the different models -> forecasts folder
  - statistics to compare the performances of different models -> MAE.xls, MSE.xls
 - Extension code -> extension folder
    - 4 main scripts: 01_data_preparation.R, 02_random_walk_oos_y.R, 03_call_model.R, 04_eval_results.R to be run in that order
    - functions called by the 4 main scripts -> functions folder
